In this project I web scrap data from Amazon, about laptops. orgenize, clean it and than put it into machine learning.
I only search for 5 brands, as to have enough data on each to make a graphs, those brand are: Apple, HP, Dell, Lenovo and ASUS.

Notes:

about the scraping: I commented the line that starts the scraping so you can to 'Run All' on the cells.
other ways the scraping will start and it takes aLONG time, but if you want just un-comment them, 
I put a comment to show which line they are.

when Saving to csv I used mode x, to make sure I don't save over a file, so I comment them for the submission.
other ways it will give you a 'bug' (which was intaned for waring me about saving over files)
I didn't do this on 3 files: urls_search_pages_0_300(Feb_3), 
prodocts_from_1223_3000(0_100)(7_feb_2023), all_page_data_0_100(6_feb)
Just ignore them, Unless you want to do scraping then the info goes there.

note: I make alot of spaling mistacks
