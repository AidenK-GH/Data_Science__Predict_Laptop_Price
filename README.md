# Data_Science__Predict_Laptop_Price
Data Science Course HIT 2023 | Aiden Kaminsky

In this project I web scrap data from Amazon, about laptops. orgenize and clean it, and than put it into machine learning.
I only search for 5 brands, as to have enoghf data on each to make a graphs, those brand are: Apple, HP, Dell, Lenovo and ASUS.

Notes:

about the scraping, I commented the line that starts the scaping so you can to 'Run All' on the cells
other ways the scraping will start and it takes aLONG time, but if you want just un-commnt them, 
I put a comment to show which line they are

when saveing to csv I used mode x, to make sure I don't save over a file, so I comment them for the submission.
other ways it will give you a 'bug' (which was intaned for waring me about saveing over files)
I didn't do this on 3 files: urls_search_pages_0_300(Feb_3), 
prodocts_from_1223_3000(0_100)(7_feb_2023), all_page_data_0_100(6_feb)
Just ignore them, Unless you want to do scraping then the info goes there.

note: I make alot of spaling mistacks
